## Why Jetson?

Jetson's job is to get out of your way.

With Jetson, you can select a Node engine once and then stop worrying about it. You can switch between projects and stop having to manually switch between Nodes. You can install npm package binaries in your toolchain without having to periodically reinstall them or figure out why they've stopped working.

### Quickly set up and switch Node engines

Fetch and use a particular version of Node:
```sh
jetson install node 11
```
You should notice right away how responsive the tool is. Your development time is precious! JavaScript developers deserve snappy tools. ðŸ™‚

### Reproducible environments for collaborators

Jetson lets you choose your Node engine and package manager for a project once with one command:
```
jetson pin node 10
```
Jetson saves the exact version of the Node engine in your `package.json` so you can commit your selection to git. From that point on, every time you run Node inside your project directory, Jetson automatically switches to that same version of Node you chose. Similarly, all your collaborators can do the same by installing Jetson on their development machine.

### Install and forget

Jetson also lets you install your favorite package binaries as command-line tools, without worrying about them interfering with your development projects. Even better, these tools get pinned to a particular Node engine at installation time and don't change unless you explicitly tell them to. This means that once a tool works, it keeps working.
```sh
jetson install surge
surge -h
```

{% include warn.html content="Installing package binaries is still a work in progress." %}

## How does it work?

Jetson does not use any fancy OS features or shell-specific hooks. It's built on the simple, proven approach of shims.

Whenever you install a tool with Jetson, it adds a shim to your `PATH` that acts as an intelligent (and fast) router to the right version of the tool and runs it with the right Node engine.

Jetson is [easy to install](./getting-started/), with no external dependencies, because it's built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) as a single, fast native executable.
